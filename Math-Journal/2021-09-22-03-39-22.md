# Notes
To be honest this is quite good, Especially if you consider the quick speed that it just takes to write down your notes, It could even do for note taking for books and all that other kind of stuff. Now my question is If I should actually write them down as for notedowns Or should I consider other type of resources![Image](./3f7549a07f8a220b05ef6422f224cdab.png)
